# Initial Ideas

### Idea 1 - PokemonGo-style app (Josh)

• At random points in the day, a non-sustainable object spawns at a random location on campus
• The first person to correctly answer the sustainable quiz / complete the challenge wins the object
• You can then fight against other people with your objects to gain levels, badges, etc.

### Idea 2 - BeReal-style app (Josh)

• At a random time, every 24 hours a new challenge will be displayed to all players
• Players must complete the task by photographing them at the place / doing the sustainable task
• A social-media type feed will be shown and people can interact with each other

### Idea 3 - Treasure hunt app (Stefan)

• Treasure will be spread out across the map according to where the gamekeepers decide to place the objects
• Treasure will have different types of rarity and there will be a competition for who has the highest amount
• People would be able to see their friends' treasure and their rarity with their respective profile.

### Idea 4 - Form Point system (Stefan)

• Players will be able to submit a form by dragging and dropping images of certain sustainable actions and where they did them. E.g. cycling to campus.
• There will be a point system according to the action that has been taken and the location that this was done in.
• There will be a leaderboard for the highest point rankings and these people will be able to redeem things within the shop.

### Idea 5 - Trash scanning game (James)

• Players will be able to take pictures at spots around the campus rewarding students for each piece of trash detected in the image.
• An AI System would be in place in order to detect key bits of trash (e.g. cigarette butts, crisp packets, plastic bottles), awarding the player a score for the taken image.
• The players will then be encouraged to bin the pieces of trash with a point reward as an incentive.
