# Project overview

The proposed project is a sustainability game that aims to promote sustainable practices in a fun and interactive way. The game utilizes a web application and a location-based adventure to engage users in sustainability practices.

Players will embark on a fun-filled adventure around their campus where they will collect virtual trash and answer sustainability-based questions to earn points. The game will feature a competitive element, with only one user able to collect each instance of generated trash. The more trash players collect, the more points they earn, which they can spend on items at the store.

To collect the trash, players need to scan a QR code at the location of the event's building and answer three sustainability-based multiple-choice questions. Correct answers will earn the players points and remove the trash from the location. Players will be able to hold a collection of their trash within their bin, where they can see their virtual environmental impact of picking up virtual trash.

The game will provide a section where sustainable resources like articles and videos will provide information on sustainable practices and links to University of Exeter's resources. Gamekeepers will be able to add, configure, edit, and delete resources, gamekeepers, store items, questions, and trash collection events.

A leaderboard displays the top scorers in virtual trash collection and encourages healthy competition among players. In-game purchases will be available only within the proximity of the forum building on Streatham Campus.
